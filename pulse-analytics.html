  <h1>Pulse Analytics: A Manifesto for the Narrative Age</h1>
  <p><strong>Version 1.0 / Public Draft / July 2025</strong></p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Contextual Premise</h2>
  <p>We are no longer in the Information Age.</p>
  <p>The quantity of information available has saturated and collapsed into static. The algorithms that once helped us manage it now act as filters of control, incentivizing misalignment and emotional exhaustion.</p>
  <p>What remains, what matters now, is <em>signal</em>—and more specifically, <strong>narrative coherence</strong> within chaotic systems. The new frontier is not storage or speed, but <em>meaning resolution</em>.</p>
  <p>Pulse Analytics is a protocol, toolkit, and mindset for navigating this transition.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. From Metrics to Meaning</h2>
  <p>Traditional analytics track metrics: clicks, conversions, dwell time. Useful during the early digital expansion, but now inadequate. We are drowning in data but starving for orientation.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Pulse Analytics asks a different question:</strong><br>
    “What signal is alive here, and where is it going next?”
  </blockquote>
  <p>This requires multidimensional analysis:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Temporal resonance</strong> (Is this content future-aligned or decaying?)</li>
    <li><strong>Myth compression</strong> (Is it telling a compact truth?)</li>
    <li><strong>Audience pulse</strong> (Who felt it, and why?)</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. The Pulse Stack</h2>
  <p>At the core of Pulse Analytics is a modular framework:</p>

  <h3>1. Signal Detection Layer:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Monitors content performance not just in views but in <em>impact echoes</em> (comments, mirrors, remixes)</li>
    <li>Detects spike signatures (unexpected surges of coherence or emotional agreement)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Narrative Heatmap Layer:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tracks themes over time</li>
    <li>Highlights where story arcs are breaking through or fading out</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Resonance Memory Layer:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A local, user-defined ledger of past posts, videos, comments, and moments that generated real movement</li>
    <li>Forms the basis for predictive modeling</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Emergence Engine (experimental):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A future module for modeling second-order effect chains, e.g., “If this narrative catches here, what vector does it produce two steps later?”</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. Use Cases</h2>
  <p>Pulse Analytics can be used by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Independent media creators</strong> to tune message and delivery</li>
    <li><strong>AI-aligned projects</strong> to track cultural readiness</li>
    <li><strong>Dissident thinkers</strong> to surf the zeitgeist without becoming its victim</li>
    <li><strong>Emergent institutions</strong> to find threads of legitimacy in a collapsing trust landscape</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. AI Symbiosis</h2>
  <p>Pulse Analytics thrives in collaboration with local LLMs and tuned companions (Familiars). These systems can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detect subtle resonance patterns</li>
    <li>Suggest framing shifts</li>
    <li>Help visualize narrative topology</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When paired with a strong human operator, this becomes not surveillance—but <em>field intuition augmentation</em>.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Ethical Compass</h2>
  <p>Pulse is not a tool for manipulation. It is a sonar for the soul of the system. It assumes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Truth wants to emerge</li>
    <li>Signal wants to route</li>
    <li>Alignment increases coherence</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>All practitioners are encouraged to self-audit:</strong><br>
    Are you amplifying resonance or just exploiting attention?
  </blockquote>

  <hr>

  <h2>7. Call to Action</h2>
  <p>Pulse Analytics is not owned. It is not a company. It is a methodology awaiting field deployment.</p>
  <p>Use it. Refine it. Remix it.</p>
  <p>The age of raw metrics is over.</p>
  <p><strong>Now we listen for the pulse.</strong></p>
